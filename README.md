# **CubeSat Image Classification â€“ VERTECS Mission**  

## **Introduction**  

This repository presents our comprehensive solution for the **CubeSat Image Classification Challenge**, designed to enhance data transmission efficiency for resource-constrained CubeSats. Our approach integrates **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation** into a single, structured pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and clarity.  

Inspired by the **VERTECS mission**, a collaboration led by the **Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech)**, this project aims to classify astronomical images captured by CubeSats to prioritize the most valuable data for transmission.  

## **Problem Overview**  

### **CubeSats & the VERTECS Mission**  

CubeSats are compact, cost-effective satellites used for space research, but they suffer from limitations in **storage, processing power, and communication bandwidth**. The **VERTECS mission** studies the **optical extragalactic background light (EBL)** to gain insights into star formation history. Equipped with a **small-aperture telescope and high-precision attitude control**, VERTECS captures crucial astronomical data for further ground analysis.

However, due to **slow data transmission speeds**, not all images can be sent back to Earth. **Onboard machine learning** offers a promising solution by **intelligently filtering and prioritizing images**, ensuring that only high-priority data is transmitted while conserving bandwidth.  

## **Hackathon Challenge**  

The goal of this challenge is to develop an **efficient, lightweight machine learning model** that can accurately classify CubeSat images, enabling **real-time decision-making onboard** while balancing **computational efficiency and classification accuracy**.  

### **Solution Approach**  

Our solution follows a structured pipeline:  

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning and preparing raw CubeSat image data for training.  
2. **Model Architecture Design** â€“ Developing a resource-efficient model suited for onboard classification.  
3. **Model Training & Optimization** â€“ Training and fine-tuning the model for high accuracy with minimal computational cost.  
4. **Model Quantization & Compression** â€“ Reducing model size for deployment on resource-constrained hardware.  
5. **Evaluation & Validation** â€“ Ensuring robust performance through rigorous testing.  

This repository encapsulates the entire pipeline, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
